# random-software-dev-info
This is software information I'm compiling together with links to the sources for my personal software dev journey.

For some reason, I thought it would be easier to just put this information in "info.txt", so that's what I did instead of just using this file. This is my first real GitHub repo that I'm making using a tutorial and terminal, so cut me slack lol. Plus, this information I've gathered is catered to me, so it may very well not be useful to you, random passerby.
